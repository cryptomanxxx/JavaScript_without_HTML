# JavaScript_without_HTML
A simple JavaScript command execution web editor where you can run your own user defined JavaScript functions from. I have at the moment created 6 user defined functions (on top of the functions required to get the web editor to work) just to show the basic concept: 

1) Function rand(n) which gives you a 1D array with length n with random numbers between -1 and 1.
2) Function rw(n) which gives you a 1D array with length n with a pure random walk.
3) Function seq(a,b) which gives you a 1D array with data from a to b. 
4) Function sum(a) which gives you the sum of a 1D array a.
5) Function plot(z) which plots a 1D array z.
6) Function clear() which clears the input, output and plot box. 

You can fork or clone the code and write and add your own user defined JavaScript functions that you want to run in the web editor.
