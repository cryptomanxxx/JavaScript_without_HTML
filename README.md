# JavaScript_without_HTML
A simple JavaScript command execution web editor where you can run your own user defined JavaScript functions. I have at the moment created 3 simple user defined functions just to show the basic concept: seq, sum and clear. You can fork or clone the code and write and add your own user defined JavaScript functions that you want to run in the web editor.
